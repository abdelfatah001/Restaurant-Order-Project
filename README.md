# Restaurant-Order-Project 
this project was applying for windows forms, .Net framwork and C# and everything i have been learnt at this time but it wasn't included database or advanced data structure.
the most advantage in this project is the logic which make all used algorithms O(1) by storing the position of each item in an object stored in a tag of the radio button.
this may be not the most effective way but it a good effective way that i decide to use in this project according my experience at this time. 
the UI is good enough to be user friendly and so that the UX.
the maintainability may be not the best way but i have improved it by all abilities i have.
this project is a sort of scalable to add bills and show all orders but the main problem is lack of database so i decide to enough with these features till learning the database.
the date of uploading this project is not the same date of finising developing this it.
